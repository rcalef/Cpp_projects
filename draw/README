CMPS 109 Summer 2013, Assignment 3

Ps2pdf ran on the output files seems to generate pdfs which
have the same images for all provided test files, except with
different page header/trailers. 

Running mk.tests on my files produces
what looks like an error message when ran on errors.dr but this isn't
any sort of crash since the running ./draw on errors.dr normally
simply prints errors, and exits with a status of 1 without memory leak.
