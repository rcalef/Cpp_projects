CMPS 109 Summer 2013, Assignment 2

Edited and added to starter code provided by:

Seems to have desired output for all provided test files,
however my implementation of multiplication does not use
and/or did not need a stack of pairs of bigints. Similarly,
the provided code for divide did not use a stack of pairs
of bigints, and there did not seem to be any need to modify
it to do such.
